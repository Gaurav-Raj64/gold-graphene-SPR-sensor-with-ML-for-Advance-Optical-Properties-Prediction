## 🔬 Abstract

We propose a novel PCF-SPR sensor structure enhanced with dual-layer gold and graphene coatings to significantly improve sensitivity and precision. The sensor was optimized using simulation (COMSOL Multiphysics), and performance parameters were predicted through machine learning models.

**Key achievements:**
- Maximum wavelength sensitivity: **12,000 nm/RIU**
- Amplitude sensitivity: **−1077.83 RIU⁻¹**
- Resolution: **8.3 × 10⁻⁷ RIU**

## 🤖 Machine Learning Integration

Machine learning models were used to predict:
- Effective refractive index (neff)
- Confinement loss

**Models Used:**
- Random Forest Regressor
- KNN Regressor
- Decision Tree Regressor
- SVR, ANN, XGBoost, Gradient Boosting

These models improved prediction accuracy and enabled performance evaluation across varying structural and material parameters.
